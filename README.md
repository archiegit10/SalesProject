# SalesProject 
## Project Overview
#### A Create, Read, Delete console application for sales of products which connects to a local SQL database
## Why are we doing this?
#### Being tasked to create a console application in C# for the sale of products and send queries to a local SQL server. Giving myself an opportunitiy to put what I have learnt from QA training into practice. 
## How I expected the challenge to go.
#### With no experience dealing with sending queries to a server, I was apprehensive of how I could do it but with examples and practice it all worked out.
## What went well?
#### The beginning of the git branches worked out until my github decided to log onto my old account and it went haywire but no work was lost, just the neat graph of my branches in pieces. 
## What didn't go as planned?
#### Not completing the extra tasks
## Possible improvements for future
#### Make more reusable methods for the queries 
## Notable mentions 
#### Aswene and Morgan and the rest of the QA trainers for teaching us all and Morgans example C# project which was of great use as my QA laptop corrupted with my movie project.
